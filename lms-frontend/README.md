## Setup and Installation

1.  **Navigate to this directory:**

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    -   This will start the Vite development server.
    ```sh
    npm run dev

### Important

For the frontend to work correctly, the backend server must also be running, as it fetches all of its data from the backend API.
